**Description:**

Computation Reconsidered is a series of hands-on workshops exploring algorithms and touch, through physical computing with microcontrollers. Together through the workshops we will investigate how haptics and proximity can play a role in how we interact with computational material and digital spaces. We will rethink and reimagine how we interact with the computer by rapidly prototyping ideas using sensors such as conductive ink, distance sensors, temperature, force resistive sensors, etc. We will learn programming concepts using the python programming language in order to work with sensor input data and the Adafruit Circuit Playground microcontroller.

In addition to working with microcontrollers, we will look at procedural graphics, spatial and generative design using Touchdesigner which will allow us to quickly work with real time graphics in connection to our sensor data and allow us to prototype ideas for multi channel installation and projection mapping. The focus of this class will be exploring various ways we can take input from the outside world and work with data from these sensors in a “real time” environment.

While basic understanding of coding is useful, it is not required as class is designed for students with no coding experience.

- In addition to class workshops, there will be coding tutorials/exercises that will be required which will supplement the class.

**Materials Needed**:

- a laptop computer will be necessary for each class.
- a mouse preferably with a middle scroll wheel. (this will make your life a lot easier)
- usb hub

*Software:*

- Mu Editor IDE (free)
- Derivative Touchdesigner (free non commercial version): [https://derivative.ca/download](https://derivative.ca/download)

*provided class materials:*

Adafruit Circuit Playground Bluefruit microcontroller

most sensors and electronics will be provided to try in class,. However you are encouraged to research sensors that will be useful for your own projects. I will try to provide a variety of sensors you can use and prototype in class.

**Grading:**

Grading will be based entirely on attendance and class participation. Attendance is critical as this will be a heavily hands on class with workshops that build off one another. So if you need to miss class, please let me know so I can catch you up, or find a fellow student who can keep you in the loop. Also if you can’t make it, please notify me and you can be excused.

**Final Project:**

There will be a final project for this class. It doesn’t have to be finished by the end of the class, but your goal will be to constantly iterate and prototype.
