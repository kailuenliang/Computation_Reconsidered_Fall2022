# Computation Reconsidered

ATEK 590-01 / IIMC-590-01
Spring 2022 

Computation Reconsidered is a series of hands-on workshops exploring algorithms and touch, through physical computing with microcontrollers. Together through the workshops we will investigate how haptics and proximity can play a role in how we interact with computational material and digital spaces. We will rethink and reimagine how we interact with the computer by rapidly prototyping ideas using sensors such as conductive ink, distance sensors, temperature, force resistive sensors, and hacked electronics. We will learn programming concepts using the python programming language in order to work with sensor input data and the Adafruit Circuit Playground microcontroller.

In addition to working with microcontrollers, we will look at procedural graphics, spatial and generative design using Touchdesigner which will allow us to quickly work with real time graphics in connection to our sensor data and allow us to prototype ideas for multi channel installation and projection mapping. The focus of this class will be exploring various ways we can take input from the outside world and work with data from these sensors in a real time environment.

While basic understanding of coding is useful, it is not required as class is designed for students with no coding experience.

- UPDATE(first few weeks on Zoom!) When allowed, *this class will meet in person unless specified (usually guest artists over Zoom).*
- In addition to class workshops, there will be coding tutorials/exercises that will be required which will supplement the class.

**Materials Needed**:

- a laptop computer will be necessary for each class.
- a mouse preferably with a middle scroll wheel.
- usb hub

*Software:*

- Mu Editor IDE (free)
- Derivative Touchdesigner (free non commercial version)
- Pure Data (open source visual programming environment for sound)

*provided class materials:*

Adafruit Circuit Playground Bluefruit microcontroller

various sensors will be provided to try in class, you are encouraged to research sensors that will be useful for your own projects. I will try to provide a variety of sensors you can use and prototype in class.
